The code and any derivatives or copies of it should never be submitted for academic credit, coursework, or in any situation where academic integrity or original authorship is required.

By accessing or using this code, you acknowledge that it was created solely for the purposes of the hackathon and that its submission and use are outside the scope of academic work. Any attempt to use, submit, or present this code as part of an academic project, research, or any other academic context is strictly prohibited.

## Legal Disclaimer and AI Assistance Disclosure

By accessing, using, or contributing to this repository, you acknowledge and agree to the following terms regarding the use of generative AI in the development of the code and documentation:

Use of Generative AI: This project involves code that has been written with the assistance of generative AI, including but not limited to tools like GPT models. The extent of AI involvement may vary, ranging from minor contributions (e.g., code suggestions) to more significant portions of the code. All contributions made by generative AI are subject to the terms outlined in this disclosure.

Hackathon Context: This code and repository are being submitted in the context of an AI-themed hackathon, where the use of AI tools and technologies is encouraged and expected. The hackathonâ€™s theme and structure reasonably imply permission for participants to employ AI-assisted technologies during development. The repository, therefore, reflects the collaborative and innovative spirit of the hackathon, where AI assistance is understood to be a legitimate and accepted tool for creating solutions.

Intent: The use of generative AI in this project is solely for constructive, collaborative purposes. There is no intention of malice, misrepresentation, or harm associated with the AI-generated content. The purpose is to assist with software development and enhance productivity while maintaining ethical standards, especially within the context of this AI-themed event.

Intellectual Property: While AI-generated content has been used in the development of this project, the project maintainers assert ownership over the final code, provided that it complies with the relevant open-source licenses governing the repository. It is important to note that the use of generative AI may introduce elements that are not entirely unique or original in nature, as generative AI models are trained on large datasets, which could include publicly available works.

Accuracy and Liability: The AI-generated code may contain errors, inaccuracies, or suboptimal solutions. Users of this repository are encouraged to review and test the code thoroughly before deploying it in production environments. The repository maintainers disclaim any liability for any consequences, damages, or issues arising from the use of the AI-generated code.

Academic Integrity: For academic use, contributors and users of this repository must ensure that they follow proper academic standards and guidelines, including citation of AI assistance where applicable. The AI-generated content should not be presented as original work in academic submissions unless appropriately acknowledged. It is the responsibility of users to ensure compliance with institutional or publication-specific rules regarding the use of AI-generated content.

Ethical Use: Users of this repository are expected to follow ethical guidelines and ensure that the code is not used for malicious purposes, such as creating harmful software, conducting unauthorized surveillance, or infringing on the rights of others.

AI Assistance in Documentation: Please note that this disclosure statement itself may have been generated or assisted by a generative AI model. While every effort has been made to ensure its accuracy and clarity, users are encouraged to critically evaluate and, if necessary, seek legal advice regarding the use of AI-generated content in any context.
